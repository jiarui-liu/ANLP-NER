       " 'abstract': 'We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a;Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be finetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspecific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Language model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015;Peters et al., 2018a;Radford et al., 2018;Howard and Ruder, 2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;Williams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the relationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering, where models are required to produce fine-grained output at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003;Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for applying pre-trained language representations to downstream tasks: feature-based and fine-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018a), uses task-specific architectures that include the pre-trained representations as additional features. The fine-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal task-specific parameters, and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply fine-tuning all pretrained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, especially for the fine-tuning approaches. The major limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of architectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-toright architecture, where every token can only attend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such restrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks, and could be very harmful when applying finetuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incorporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the fine-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidirectionality constraint by using a \"masked language model\" (MLM) pre-training objective, inspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike left-toright language model pre-training, the MLM objective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pretrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addition to the masked language model, we also use a \"next sentence prediction\" task that jointly pretrains text-pair representations. The contributions of our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Unlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirectional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pretrained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered taskspecific architectures. BERT is the first finetuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outperforming many task-specific architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven NLP tasks.

Pre-trained word embeddings are an integral part of modern NLP systems, offering significant improvements over embeddings learned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pretrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right language modeling objectives have been used (Mnih and Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to discriminate correct from incorrect words in left and right context .\\nThese approaches have been generalized to coarser granularities, such as sentence embeddings Logeswaran and Lee, 2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014). To train sentence representations, prior work has used objectives to rank candidate next sentences (Jernite et al., 2017;Logeswaran and Lee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sentence words given a representation of the previous sentence , or denoising autoencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017(Peters et al., , 2018a generalize traditional word embedding research along a different dimension. They extract context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a right-to-left language model. The contextual representation of each token is the concatenation of the left-to-right and right-to-left representations. When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-specific architectures, ELMo advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including question answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning contextual representations through a task to predict a single word from both left and right context using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used to improve the robustness of text generation models.',\n",

       "   'text': 'We introduce BERT and its detailed implementation in this section. There are two steps in our framework: pre-training and fine-tuning. During pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled data over different pre-training tasks. For finetuning, the BERT model is first initialized with the pre-trained parameters, and all of the parameters are fine-tuned using labeled data from the downstream tasks. Each downstream task has separate fine-tuned models, even though they are initialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The question-answering example in Figure 1 will serve as a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its unified architecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architecture and the final downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT\\'s model architecture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder based on the original implementation described in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in the tensor2tensor library. 1 Because the use of Transformers has become common and our implementation is almost identical to the original, we will omit an exhaustive background description of the model architecture and refer readers to Vaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides such as \"The Annotated Transformer.\" 2 In this work, we denote the number of layers (i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as H, and the number of self-attention heads as A. 3 We primarily report results on two model sizes: BERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-eters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024, A=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model size as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes. Critically, however, the BERT Transformer uses bidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Transformer uses constrained self-attention where every token can only attend to context to its left. 4 Input/Output Representations To make BERT handle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input representation is able to unambiguously represent both a single sentence and a pair of sentences (e.g., Question, Answer ) in one token sequence. Throughout this work, a \"sentence\" can be an arbitrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual linguistic sentence. A \"sequence\" refers to the input token sequence to BERT, which may be a single sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al., 2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The first token of every sequence is always a special classification token ([CLS]). The final hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification tasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence. We differentiate the sentences in two ways. First, we separate them with a special token ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embedding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1, we denote input embedding as E, the final hidden vector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ R H , and the final hidden vector for the i th input token as\\nT i ∈ R H .\\nFor a given token, its input representation is constructed by summing the corresponding token, segment, and position embeddings. A visualization of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Unlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al. (2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models to pre-train BERT. Instead, we pre-train BERT using two unsupervised tasks, described in this section. This step is presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reasonable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is strictly more powerful than either a left-to-right model or the shallow concatenation of a left-toright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately, standard conditional language models can only be trained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirectional conditioning would allow each word to indirectly \"see itself\", and the model could trivially predict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a \"Transformer encoder\" while the left-context-only version is referred to as a \"Transformer decoder\" since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representation, we simply mask some percentage of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We refer to this procedure as a \"masked LM\" (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this case, the final hidden vectors corresponding to the mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our experiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece tokens in each sequence at random. In contrast to denoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we only predict the masked words rather than reconstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirectional pre-trained model, a downside is that we are creating a mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not appear during fine-tuning. To mitigate this, we do not always replace \"masked\" words with the actual [MASK] token. The training data generator chooses 15% of the token positions at random for prediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace the i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of the time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3) the unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then, T i will be used to predict the original token with cross entropy loss. We compare variations of this procedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) Many important downstream tasks such as Question Answering (QA) and Natural Language Inference (NLI) are based on understanding the relationship between two sentences, which is not directly captured by language modeling. In order to train a model that understands sentence relationships, we pre-train for a binarized next sentence prediction task that can be trivially generated from any monolingual corpus. Specifically, when choosing the sentences A and B for each pretraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext), and 50% of the time it is a random sentence from the corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show in Figure 1, C is used for next sentence prediction (NSP). 5 Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this task is very beneficial to both QA and NLI. 6  The NSP task is closely related to representationlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and Logeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior work, only sentence embeddings are transferred to down-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all parameters to initialize end-task model parameters.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Fine-tuning is straightforward since the selfattention mechanism in the Transformer allows BERT to model many downstream taskswhether they involve single text or text pairs-by swapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common pattern is to independently encode text pairs before applying bidirectional cross attention, such as Parikh et al. ( 2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT instead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify these two stages, as encoding a concatenated text pair with self-attention effectively includes bidirectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the taskspecific inputs and outputs into BERT and finetune all the parameters end-to-end. At the input, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training are analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphrasing, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3) question-passage pairs in question answering, and (4) a degenerate text-∅ pair in text classification or sequence tagging. At the output, the token representations are fed into an output layer for tokenlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question answering, and the [CLS] representation is fed into an output layer for classification, such as entailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, fine-tuning is relatively inexpensive. All of the results in the paper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a single Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting from the exact same pre-trained model. 7 We describe the task-specific details in the corresponding subsections of Section 4.

The only new parameters introduced during fine-tuning are classification layer weights W ∈ R K×H , where K is the number of labels. We compute a standard classification loss with C and W , i.e., log(softmax(CW T )).  We use a batch size of 32 and fine-tune for 3 epochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each task, we selected the best fine-tuning learning rate (among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set. Additionally, for BERT LARGE we found that finetuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets, so we ran several random restarts and selected the best model on the Dev set. With random restarts, we use the same pre-trained checkpoint but perform different fine-tuning data shuffling and classifier layer initialization. 9 Results are presented in Table 1. Both BERT BASE and BERT LARGE outperform all systems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining 4.5% and 7.0% respective average accuracy improvement over the prior state of the art.

The left-only constraint was also applied at fine-tuning, because removing it introduced a pre-train/fine-tune mismatch that degraded downstream performance. Additionally, this model was pre-trained without the NSP task. This is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but using our larger training dataset, our input representation, and our fine-tuning scheme.\\nWe first examine the impact brought by the NSP task. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP hurts performance significantly on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact of training bidirectional representations by comparing \"No NSP\" to \"LTR & No NSP\". The LTR model performs worse than the MLM model on all tasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR model will perform poorly at token predictions, since the token-level hidden states have no rightside context. In order to make a good faith attempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added a randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does significantly improve results on SQuAD, but the results are still far worse than those of the pretrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts performance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to train separate LTR and RTL models and represent each token as the concatenation of the two models, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as expensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this is non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL model would not be able to condition the answer on the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful than a deep bidirectional model, since it can use both left and right context at every layer.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In this section, we explore the effect of model size on fine-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number of BERT models with a differing number of layers, hidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise using the same hyperparameters and training procedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in Table 6. In this table, we report the average Dev Set accuracy from 5 random restarts of fine-tuning. We can see that larger models lead to a strict accuracy improvement across all four datasets, even for MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled training examples, and is substantially different from the pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surprising that we are able to achieve such significant improvements on top of models which are already quite large relative to the existing literature. For example, the largest Transformer explored in Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16) with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the largest Transformer we have found in the literature is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE contains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE contains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, which is demonstrated by the LM perplexity of held-out training data shown in Table 6. However, we believe that this is the first work to demonstrate convincingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been sufficiently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented mixed results on the downstream task impact of increasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two to four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) mentioned in passing that increasing hidden dimension size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing further to 1,000 did not bring further improvements. Both of these prior works used a featurebased approach -we hypothesize that when the model is fine-tuned directly on the downstream tasks and uses only a very small number of randomly initialized additional parameters, the taskspecific models can benefit from the larger, more expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small.',\n",

       "   'text': 'All of the BERT results presented so far have used the fine-tuning approach, where a simple classification layer is added to the pre-trained model, and all parameters are jointly fine-tuned on a downstream task. However, the feature-based approach, where fixed features are extracted from the pretrained model, has certain advantages. First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Transformer encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-specific model architecture to be added. Second, there are major computational benefits to pre-compute an expensive representation of the training data once and then run many experiments with cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data. Following standard practice, we formulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF   layer in the output. We use the representation of the first sub-token as the input to the token-level classifier over the NER label set.\\nTo ablate the fine-tuning approach, we apply the feature-based approach by extracting the activations from one or more layers without fine-tuning any parameters of BERT. These contextual embeddings are used as input to a randomly initialized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before the classification layer.\\nResults are presented in Table 7. BERT LARGE performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods. The best performing method concatenates the token representations from the top four hidden layers of the pre-trained Transformer, which is only 0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model. This demonstrates that BERT is effective for both finetuning and feature-based approaches.',\n",

The purpose of this is to bias the representation towards the actual observed word.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the Transformer encoder does not know which words it will be asked to predict or which have been replaced by random words, so it is forced to keep a distributional contextual representation of every input token. Additionally, because random replacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens (i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm the model's language understanding capability.

The comparisons between the model architectures are shown visually in Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architecture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are finetuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training method to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a left-to-right Transformer LM on a large text corpus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT were intentionally made to make it as close to GPT as possible so that the two methods could be minimally compared. The core argument of this work is that the bi-directionality and the two pretraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for the majority of the empirical improvements, but we do note that there are several other differences between how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words); BERT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( • GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for all fine-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a task-specific fine-tuning learning rate which performs the best on the development set.\\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we perform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which demonstrate that the majority of the improvements are in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks and the bidirectionality they enable.',\n",

The following is an ablation study to evaluate the effect of different masking strategies. Note that the purpose of the masking strategies is to reduce the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never appears during the fine-tuning stage. We report the Dev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER, we report both fine-tuning and feature-based approaches, as we expect the mismatch will be amplified for the feature-based approach as the model will not have the chance to adjust the representations.  The results are presented in Table 8. In the table, MASK means that we replace the target token with the [MASK] symbol for MLM; SAME means that we keep the target token as is; RND means that we replace the target token with another random token.\\nThe numbers in the left part of the table represent the probabilities of the specific strategies used during MLM pre-training (BERT uses 80%, 10%, 10%).

    "txt = 'The central goal of neuroscience, arguably, is to understand the mechanisms or causal chains that give rise to activity in the brain, to perception, cognition, and action. Complex systems such as the brain are hard to understand because of the numerous ways the contributing elements may interact internally (Jonas and Kording, 2017). Because of this, it is not sufficient to know the correlations between variables or even be able to predict them. While observing correlations within the system is relatively easy, transitioning from observed correlations to a causal or mechanistic understanding is hard. After all, there can be many ways that the same activities emerge from distinct causal chains (Drton et al., 2011;Peters et al., 2017). Reaching a mechanistic level of understanding in the mammalian brain is incredibly hard as they contain countless neurons (e.g. 86 billion in the human brain (Azevedo et al., 2009)), each of which influences many other neurons. Even if we could record all neurons at the same time, estimating causality and producing a mechanistic understanding would be extremely challenging.\\nIn today\\'s typical studies, we only record from a small subset of all neurons. The data we obtain from such recordings, e.g. from electrophysiology or calcium imaging, is observational, which means that it does not result from randomized perturbations. In such cases, we can never know to which level the observed activity was caused by other observed activity, or by unobserved activity. The activity of the unobserved neurons is thus called confounders. If mechanisms are estimated from observational data in the presence of confounders, the consequence may be large errors and incorrect conclusions (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). Unobserved neural activity confounds estimates of causal interactions and makes it difficult to estimate underlying mechanisms.\\nConfounding is the big threat to causal validity (Pearl, 2009) irrespective of the use of simple regression techniques or advanced functional connectivity techniques (Stevenson et al., 2008;Honey et al., 2009;Aitchison and Lengyel, 2017;Pfau et al., 2013). To estimate connectivity it is first and foremost important that the used signals reflect cause and effect, therefore we use the term causal connectivity. Consider an example where we want to estimate causal connectivity between two observed, but unconnected neurons, A and C (Fig. 2(a)) by stimulating optogenetically. A third unobserved neuron B, is driven together with A by a common input and they are thus strongly correlated. Furthermore, B and C are connected, thus the input drives C through B. Consequently, A and C are also correlated and the regression C = βA+noise will misleadingly conclude a direct interaction when causally interpreted. In this case, we say the regressor A is endogenous and the regression coefficient β estimates the magnitude of association rather than the magnitude of causation. Naïve regressions in partially observed systems will generally not reveal causality.\\nA much used method for estimating the output of single neurons is to perform multiple regression analyses (Pillow et al., 2008;Roudi et al., 2009), modeling each neuron with a generalized linear model (GLM). Multiple regression may be a solution to confounding problems as they support \"explaining away\" background activity (Stevenson et al., 2008). However, this is only a meaningful strategy if most neurons are included in the recordings. Furthermore, only under certain assumptions about nonlinearity or noise sources does a fully observed system become identifiable (Daniusis et al., 2012;Shimizu et al., 2006). This is rarely the case in experimental settings, especially in the mammalian brain. Thus, brain data, will almost never satisfy the criteria needed for identifiability (Pearl, 2009). We thus aim to develop methods that can identify causal connectivity between neuron pairs.\\nTo estimate causal relationships between neurons, stimulating the presynaptic neuron is the gold standard. In fact, a common definition of causality is in terms of the effect of changing one variable in the system, independently of changing other variables -an intervention (Pearl, 2009). If we stimulate single neurons, the ability to estimate causal relationships by regression is within reach. However, this is experimentally challenging and yields low cell count because it requires intracellular, juxtacellular or two-photon stimulation (Pinault, 1996;Lerman et al., 2017;Nikolenko et al., 2007;Emiliani et al., 2015). Because gold-standard perturbations are challenging, it is necessary and highly desirable if causality could be obtained from optogenetic stimulation in combination with neural recordings of large populations of neurons (Boyden et al., 2005;Zemelman et al., 2002).\\nInterpreting the results from optogenetic stimulation in terms of causal interactions is difficult. In most experimental settings, optogenetic stimulation will affect many neurons simultaneously. Hence, the stimulus will produce a distributed pattern of activity. This distributed pattern of stimulation produces activity which then percolates through the network of neurons. Thus any postsynaptic activity induced by stimulation could in principle come from any of the stimulated neurons, introducing problematic confounders.\\nFor insights into how we may resolve the confounding problem induced by optogenetic stimulation, we may look to other fields that have addressed the problem of endogenous regressors. The inference of causality from observational data is addressed in the fields of statistics (Pearl, 2009), machine learning (Peters et al., 2017) and econometrics (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). These fields have extensively worked on methods to estimate causality in the face of potential confounding and may offer us clues on how to solve our problems.\\nA commonly used approach towards causal inference in economics are instrumental variables, invented by Wright (1928); see Appendix B. Let us say that we want to estimate the return β from education x to yearly wages y with the regression y = βx+u. Here u are the factors other than education that contribute to yearly wages. One of the factors in u is a person\\'s cognitive ability which may also affect education. The regressor x is thus correlated with the error term u. This will imply that the regression estimate of β will not estimate the magnitude of causation from education on wages, but rather, its association. In this case one may use the proximity to a college or university as an instrumental variable (IV) (Card, 1993). This is following the idea that proximity to a college does not affect your cognitive ability but may affect your proclivity to attend college. We expect living in proximity of colleges and universities to give higher probability to attend without affecting other contributing factors to wages such as cognitive ability. Then, in order to attribute the causal effect of education on wages one may calculate the ratio of covariances β = cov(proximity, wages)/cov(proximity, education). This ratio corrects for the confounding factor.\\nThe IV technique has been used extensively in econometrics and can provide provable unbiased causal estimates given three main assumptions (Angrist and Pischke, 2008). First, the instrument must be decorrelated with the error term. Second, the instrument must be correlated with the regressor. Third, there must be no direct influence of the instrument on the outcome variable, but only an influence through the regressor variable. The validity of these assumptions is central when using the IV approach.\\nFor an instrument to be good, it needs to be unaffected by other variables. In the brain, almost everything is affected by the network state. However, certain variables can be more or less affected. For example, the overall activity of the network is due to slow and strongly nonrandom dynamics. In contrast, the temporal pattern of when a neuron is in a refractory state may be in good approximation random. First, if neurons are spiking according to conditional Poisson distributions, their exact timing conditioned on the network state, will be random. While refractoriness may not be perfectly random, the exact times of spiking are notoriously difficult to predict (Stevenson et al., 2008) suggesting that refractoriness is quite random.\\nHere we show that the IV technique can be employed if one seeks to estimate the causal connectivity between neuron pairs. We begin by showing how confounding factors are introduced by conventional optogenetic stimulations. We then simulate this confounding effect in a simple network of three leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neurons. With this simple model we show that by using the refractory period as an IV we are able to distinguish between connected and unconnected neuron pairs. We compare these estimates with a naïve, although widely used, cross-correlation histogram (CCH) method that fails to distinguish respective pairs. We then turn to a simulated network of randomly recurrent connections of excitatory and inhibitory LIF neurons with distributed synaptic weights. With this data at hand, we first calculate the mean squared errors of the IV method and show that it is robust to different simulated network states. We also compare the amount and size of false positive and false negative estimates and goodness of fit on synaptic weights with pairwise assessments using CCH and logistic regression. Finally, we tested the methods on experimental data from extracellular recordings of single unit activity from optogenetically perturbed ensembles of neurons in the hippocampus. The observed differences between the IV and the CCH estimate, underline the importance of considering potential confounding, when estimating connections based on neural activity.'"

       "'The central goal of neuroscience , arguably , is to understand the mechanisms or causal chains that give rise to activity in the brain , to perception , cognition , and action . Complex systems such as the brain are hard to understand because of the numerous ways the contributing elements may interact internally ( Jonas and Kording , 2017 ) . Because of this , it is not sufficient to know the correlations between variables or even be able to predict them . While observing correlations within the system is relatively easy , transitioning from observed correlations to a causal or mechanistic understanding is hard . After all , there can be many ways that the same activities emerge from distinct causal chains ( Drton et al . , 2011;Peters et al . , 2017 ) . Reaching a mechanistic level of understanding in the mammalian brain is incredibly hard as they contain countless neurons ( e.g. 86 billion in the human brain ( Azevedo et al . , 2009 ) ) , each of which influences many other neurons . Even if we could record all neurons at the same time , estimating causality and producing a mechanistic understanding would be extremely challenging . In today \\'s typical studies , we only record from a small subset of all neurons . The data we obtain from such recordings , e.g. from electrophysiology or calcium imaging , is observational , which means that it does not result from randomized perturbations . In such cases , we can never know to which level the observed activity was caused by other observed activity , or by unobserved activity . The activity of the unobserved neurons is thus called confounders . If mechanisms are estimated from observational data in the presence of confounders , the consequence may be large errors and incorrect conclusions ( Angrist and Pischke , 2008 ) . Unobserved neural activity confounds estimates of causal interactions and makes it difficult to estimate underlying mechanisms . Confounding is the big threat to causal validity ( Pearl , 2009 ) irrespective of the use of simple regression techniques or advanced functional connectivity techniques ( Stevenson et al . , 2008;Honey et al . , 2009;Aitchison and Lengyel , 2017;Pfau et al . , 2013 ) . To estimate connectivity it is first and foremost important that the used signals reflect cause and effect , therefore we use the term causal connectivity . Consider an example where we want to estimate causal connectivity between two observed , but unconnected neurons , A and C ( Fig . 2(a ) ) by stimulating optogenetically . A third unobserved neuron B , is driven together with A by a common input and they are thus strongly correlated . Furthermore , B and C are connected , thus the input drives C through B. Consequently , A and C are also correlated and the regression C = βA+noise will misleadingly conclude a direct interaction when causally interpreted . In this case , we say the regressor A is endogenous and the regression coefficient β estimates the magnitude of association rather than the magnitude of causation . Naïve regressions in partially observed systems will generally not reveal causality . A much used method for estimating the output of single neurons is to perform multiple regression analyses ( Pillow et al . , 2008;Roudi et al . , 2009 ) , modeling each neuron with a generalized linear model ( GLM ) . Multiple regression may be a solution to confounding problems as they support \" explaining away \" background activity ( Stevenson et al . , 2008 ) . However , this is only a meaningful strategy if most neurons are included in the recordings . Furthermore , only under certain assumptions about nonlinearity or noise sources does a fully observed system become identifiable ( Daniusis et al . , 2012;Shimizu et al . , 2006 ) . This is rarely the case in experimental settings , especially in the mammalian brain . Thus , brain data , will almost never satisfy the criteria needed for identifiability ( Pearl , 2009 ) . We thus aim to develop methods that can identify causal connectivity between neuron pairs . To estimate causal relationships between neurons , stimulating the presynaptic neuron is the gold standard . In fact , a common definition of causality is in terms of the effect of changing one variable in the system , independently of changing other variables -an intervention ( Pearl , 2009 ) . If we stimulate single neurons , the ability to estimate causal relationships by regression is within reach . However , this is experimentally challenging and yields low cell count because it requires intracellular , juxtacellular or two - photon stimulation ( Pinault , 1996;Lerman et al . , 2017;Nikolenko et al . , 2007;Emiliani et al . , 2015 ) . Because gold - standard perturbations are challenging , it is necessary and highly desirable if causality could be obtained from optogenetic stimulation in combination with neural recordings of large populations of neurons ( Boyden et al . , 2005;Zemelman et al . , 2002).Interpreting the results from optogenetic stimulation in terms of causal interactions is difficult . In most experimental settings , optogenetic stimulation will affect many neurons simultaneously . Hence , the stimulus will produce a distributed pattern of activity . This distributed pattern of stimulation produces activity which then percolates through the network of neurons . Thus any postsynaptic activity induced by stimulation could in principle come from any of the stimulated neurons , introducing problematic confounders . For insights into how we may resolve the confounding problem induced by optogenetic stimulation , we may look to other fields that have addressed the problem of endogenous regressors . The inference of causality from observational data is addressed in the fields of statistics ( Pearl , 2009 ) , machine learning ( Peters et al . , 2017 ) and econometrics ( Angrist and Pischke , 2008 ) . These fields have extensively worked on methods to estimate causality in the face of potential confounding and may offer us clues on how to solve our problems . A commonly used approach towards causal inference in economics are instrumental variables , invented by Wright ( 1928 ) ; see Appendix B. Let us say that we want to estimate the return β from education x to yearly wages y with the regression y = βx+u . Here u are the factors other than education that contribute to yearly wages . One of the factors in u is a person \\'s cognitive ability which may also affect education . The regressor x is thus correlated with the error term u. This will imply that the regression estimate of β will not estimate the magnitude of causation from education on wages , but rather , its association . In this case one may use the proximity to a college or university as an instrumental variable ( IV ) ( Card , 1993 ) . This is following the idea that proximity to a college does not affect your cognitive ability but may affect your proclivity to attend college . We expect living in proximity of colleges and universities to give higher probability to attend without affecting other contributing factors to wages such as cognitive ability . Then , in order to attribute the causal effect of education on wages one may calculate the ratio of covariances β = cov(proximity , wages)/cov(proximity , education ) . This ratio corrects for the confounding factor . The IV technique has been used extensively in econometrics and can provide provable unbiased causal estimates given three main assumptions ( Angrist and Pischke , 2008 ) . First , the instrument must be decorrelated with the error term . Second , the instrument must be correlated with the regressor . Third , there must be no direct influence of the instrument on the outcome variable , but only an influence through the regressor variable . The validity of these assumptions is central when using the IV approach . For an instrument to be good , it needs to be unaffected by other variables . In the brain , almost everything is affected by the network state . However , certain variables can be more or less affected . For example , the overall activity of the network is due to slow and strongly nonrandom dynamics . In contrast , the temporal pattern of when a neuron is in a refractory state may be in good approximation random . First , if neurons are spiking according to conditional Poisson distributions , their exact timing conditioned on the network state , will be random . While refractoriness may not be perfectly random , the exact times of spiking are notoriously difficult to predict ( Stevenson et al . , 2008 ) suggesting that refractoriness is quite random . Here we show that the IV technique can be employed if one seeks to estimate the causal connectivity between neuron pairs . We begin by showing how confounding factors are introduced by conventional optogenetic stimulations . We then simulate this confounding effect in a simple network of three leaky integrate and fire ( LIF ) neurons . With this simple model we show that by using the refractory period as an IV we are able to distinguish between connected and unconnected neuron pairs . We compare these estimates with a naïve , although widely used , cross - correlation histogram ( CCH ) method that fails to distinguish respective pairs . We then turn to a simulated network of randomly recurrent connections of excitatory and inhibitory LIF neurons with distributed synaptic weights . With this data at hand , we first calculate the mean squared errors of the IV method and show that it is robust to different simulated network states . We also compare the amount and size of false positive and false negative estimates and goodness of fit on synaptic weights with pairwise assessments using CCH and logistic regression . Finally , we tested the methods on experimental data from extracellular recordings of single unit activity from optogenetically perturbed ensembles of neurons in the hippocampus . The observed differences between the IV and the CCH estimate , underline the importance of considering potential confounding , when estimating connections based on neural activity .\\n'"
